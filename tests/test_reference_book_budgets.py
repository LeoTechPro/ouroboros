"""Per-chapter byte budgets for the two reference books.

Official-CI ``size_ratchet`` lane only (local runs exclude the marker, like the repository size
gates): a chapter may grow past its budget only in a diff that raises the number here and says
why. The budget is the chapter's size after the compression pass plus roughly ten percent, so
ordinary maintenance fits and accretion does not. The same maintenance margin applies to unchanged registry chapters.
